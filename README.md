# PlantComp2022 Workshop 2

Organised by Olivier Pieters and Francis wyffels.

Commercial data acquisition systems are accurate, but expensive, thus the amount of sensors is typically limited. Modern microcontroller platforms with wide support (e.g. Arduino) can be used as an alternative to interface a wide range of analogue and digital sensors. In this workshop we open this black box and show how microcontroller platforms work and how they can be used to obtain environmental sensor data.

## Installation on Windows

You need to download and unpack the following software (no admin privilages required):
- [WinPython](https://github.com/winpython/winpython/releases/download/4.7.20220709final/Winpython64-3.10.5.0.exe)

Open WinPython and let the installer unpack it to a desirable location on your computer (such as Downloads or Documents)

## Installation on Linux / MacOS

Mac users should install Python using [brew](https://brew.sh).

Linux users probably have Python already installed. 

## Libraries

You only have to download these if you are working from your own Python installation. Installation is _not_ required when WinPython is used.

Make sure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- pyserial
- matplotlib
- pandas

## Licence

MIT
